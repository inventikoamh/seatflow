# Masjid Seat Allocation Domain Concepts

## Core Entities and Terminology

### Family and Individual Management
- **Sabeel**: A family unit in the Dawoodi Bohra community
- **Sabeel_no**: Unique numerical code assigned to each family (primary identifier)
- **Mumin**: Individual member of a family (plural: Mumineen)
- **ITS_ID**: 8-digit unique numerical identifier for each person/mumin

### Geographic and Organizational Structure
- **Sector**: Geographic divisions within large residential societies
  - Example: Saifee Nagar divided into Ezzi, Fakhri, Hakimi, Shujai sectors
  - Each sector contains 400-500 houses (buildings and bungalows)
- **Anjuman**: The organizational body that manages community affairs
- **Masjid**: Large prayer hall with multiple floors and sections
  - Separate areas for men and women (no common locations)
  - Different floors and sections for different capacity needs

### Financial and Contribution System
- **Niyaz_takhmeen**: Financial contribution amount made by families to Jamaat/Anjuman
- **Jamaat**: Community organization (same as Anjuman)
- **Contribution Priority**: Higher contributions receive preference in seat allocation

### Event Management
- **Ramzaan**: Major religious event requiring seat allocation
- **Ashara**: Major religious event requiring seat allocation
- **Event-wise Details**: Each event has specific requirements and constraints

## Data Relationships

### Family Hierarchy
```
Sabeel (Family)
├── sabeel_no (unique family identifier)
├── niyaz_takhmeen (contribution amount)
├── sector (geographic location)
└── Mumineen (family members)
    ├── ITS_ID (8-digit unique identifier)
    ├── name
    ├── gender (affects masjid section assignment)
    └── age/status
```

### Seat Allocation Logic
1. **Priority System**: Based on niyaz_takhmeen contribution
2. **Gender Separation**: Men and women in separate masjid sections
3. **Sector Consideration**: Geographic proximity may be a factor
4. **Event-specific Rules**: Different rules for Ramzaan vs Ashara

## Business Rules

### Seat Allocation Principles
- Higher niyaz_takhmeen = higher priority for seat assignment
- Gender-based section assignment (mandatory separation)
- Family-based allocation (sabeel as base unit)
- Event-specific capacity and requirements

### Data Integrity Requirements
- sabeel_no must be unique across all families
- ITS_ID must be unique across all individuals
- niyaz_takhmeen must be non-negative numeric value
- Sector must be valid from predefined list
- Gender field required for masjid section assignment

### Validation Rules
- ITS_ID must be exactly 8 digits
- sabeel_no must be numeric and unique
- Family members must belong to valid sabeel
- Seat assignments must respect gender separation
- Contribution amounts must be valid currency values
